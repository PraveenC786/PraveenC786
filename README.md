# Projects
## Project 1 - [Praveen Book Store](https://github.com/PraveenC786/Praveen-Book-Store.git)

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based Online Book Store 
that allows users to easily register, search for books by title, add them to a 
shopping cart, place orders, and manage their purchases. The system also 
provides functionality for viewing past orders and canceling them. It aims to 
streamline the book purchasing process by providing an intuitive and 
responsive user interface, coupled with a robust backend using modern Java 
technologies.

## Project 2 - [Online Utility Bill Payment System]()
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a RESTful 
backend system for an Online Utility Bill Payment 
System using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Spring Data 
JPA.  
The system allows: 
- Users to register, view their bills, and make 
payments 
- Admins to generate bills, and monitor users, bills, 
and payments 

This service is backend-only, exposed via REST APIs, 
and testable using tools like Postman.
